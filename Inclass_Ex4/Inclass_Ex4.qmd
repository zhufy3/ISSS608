## 1 Get started

In this In-class exercise, we will explore more interesting packages to visualize data with statistical summary information shown in the plots.

## 2 Packages used

Packages will be used in this exercise are:

-   *plotly*

-   *tidyverse*

-   *DT*

-   *patchwork*

```{r}
pacman::p_load(plotly, tidyverse, DT, patchwork)
```

## 3 Data used

Data we will use in this exercise is *Exam_data.csv,* and we can import the data with codes chunk below.

```{r}
exam_data<-read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## 4 Working with visual variable: *plot_ly()* method

Today we are going to explore the function `plot_ly()` to create an interactive plot.

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data,
        x = ~ENGLISH,
        y = ~MATHS,
        color = ~RACE)
```
