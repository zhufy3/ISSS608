The data has a total of 322 rows.\nLet’s take a quick look at statistics summary of the data imported using summary() function.\n\nsummary(exam_data)\n\n      ID               CLASS              GENDER              RACE          \n Length:322         Length:322         Length:322         Length:322        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n    ENGLISH          MATHS          SCIENCE     \n Min.   :21.00   Min.   : 9.00   Min.   :15.00  \n 1st Qu.:59.00   1st Qu.:58.00   1st Qu.:49.25  \n Median :70.00   Median :74.00   Median :65.00  \n Mean   :67.18   Mean   :69.33   Mean   :61.16  \n 3rd Qu.:78.00   3rd Qu.:85.00   3rd Qu.:74.75  \n Max.   :96.00   Max.   :99.00   Max.   :96.00  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s use functions in ggplot2 package to describe attributes of the data by plotting different graphs. First let’s take a look at the MATHS grade by plotting a histgram for each class.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20,\n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color = \"black\",\n                 fill = \"light blue\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths Scores\")\n\n\n\n\nNow we can also display gender attributes by assigning blue to Male and red to Female in the histogram.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20,\n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths Scores\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let us see the distribution of MATHS scores in a kernel density estimate plot using code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS))+\n  geom_density() + \n  ggtitle(\"Density of Maths Scores\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, it shows that the density of Maths scores fits a left skewed bell-shaped distribution. And the mean of the distribution lays around 80.\nThen we can plot two kernel density lines for different genders by using chunk below.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           color = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that two kernel density lines for different genders are very similar.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also plot boxplots of Maths scores for genders to visualise statistics attributes like Median, two hinges, two whiskers, outliers and mean by using codes below.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n       x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",\n               fun.y = \"mean\",\n               color = \"red\",\n               size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nNoted that the Maths scores of Male are bit higher than that of Female. But the range of Maths scores of Male is larger than that of Female.\n\n\n\nThen let us plot Notched plot by using codes below to make boxplot more visulised.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also integrate point plot and boxplot together.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\",\n             size = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. The code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\nNoted that Male has lower Maths scores than Female and higher scores than Female. And both gender’s Maths scores congregate around 80.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below combined a violin plot and a boxplot to show the distribution of Maths scores by gender.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"light blue\") +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5)           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s plot point graph to show correlation between MATHS scores and ENGLISH scores by using code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),\n                  ylim = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),\n                  ylim = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_dark()\n\n\n\n\nNoted an obvious poisitive linear correlation between Maths score and English score.\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),\n                  ylim = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceting generates small multiples, each displaying a different subset of the data. And facets are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables.\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot for distribution of Maths score using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bin = 20) +\n  facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see distributions of Maths scores by class 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, 3I.\n\n\n\nWe can slice the Maths scores in each class by gender for boxplots as shown below.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = CLASS)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER)\n\n\n\n\nAlso we can show the plot in vertical direction.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = CLASS)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER,\n             dir = \"v\")\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~GENDER+CLASS,\n             nrow = 2,\n             drop = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let us plot bar charts using functions in ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"light blue\", colour = \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = fct_infreq(RACE))) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"Race\") +\n  ylab(\"No. of Pupils\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = ..count..),vjust = -1) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,210))\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~GENDER)"
