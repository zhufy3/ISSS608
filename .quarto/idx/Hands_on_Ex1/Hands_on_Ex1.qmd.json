First let's take a look at the *MATHS* grade by plotting a histgram for each class.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20,\n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color = \"black\",\n                 fill = \"light blue\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths Scores\")\n```\n\nNow we can also display gender attributes by assigning blue to *Male* and red to *Female* in the histogram.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20,\n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths Scores\")\n```\n\n### 4.2 Density plotting\n\nNow let us see the distribution of *MATHS* scores in a kernel density estimate plot using code chunk below.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS))+\n  geom_density() + \n  ggtitle(\"Density of Maths Scores\")\n```\n\nFrom the plot above, it shows that the density of Maths scores fits a left skewed bell-shaped distribution. And the mean of the distribution lays around 80.\n\nThen we can plot two kernel density lines for different genders by using chunk below.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           color = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\nWe can see that two kernel density lines for different genders are very similar.\n\n### 4.3 Boxplot\n\n#### 4.3.1 Boxplot\n\nWe can also plot boxplots of Maths scores for genders to visualise statistics attributes like *Median, two hinges, two whiskers,* *outliers* and *mean* by using codes below.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n       x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",\n               fun.y = \"mean\",\n               color = \"red\",\n               size = 4)\n```\n\nNoted that the Maths scores of Male are bit higher than that of Female. But the range of Maths scores of Male is larger than that of Female.\n\n#### 4.3.2 Notchplot\n\nThen let us plot *Notched* plot by using codes below to make boxplot more visulised.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)\n```\n\n#### 4.3.3 Integrated boxplot and point plot\n\nWe can also integrate point plot and boxplot together.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\",\n             size = 0.5)\n```\n\n## 5 Violin plotting\n\n### 5.1 Violin plotting\n\nViolin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. The code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n```\n\nNoted that Male has lower Maths scores than Female and higher scores than Female. And both gender's Maths scores congregate around 80.\n\n### 5.2 Integrated violin and boxplot\n\nThe code chunk below combined a violin plot and a boxplot to show the distribution of Maths scores by gender.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"light blue\") +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5)           \n```\n\n## 6 Scattered plotting\n\nNow let's plot point graph to show correlation between *MATHS* scores and *ENGLISH* scores by using code chunk below.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),\n                  ylim = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\nThe interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),\n                  ylim = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_dark()\n```\n\nNoted an obvious **poisitive linear correlation** between Maths score and English score.\n\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),\n                  ylim = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n## 7 Faceting\n\nFaceting generates small multiples, each displaying a different subset of the data. And facets are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables.\n\n#### 7.1 Faceting of distributions\n\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot for distribution of Maths score using `facet-wrap()`.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bin = 20) +\n  facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n```\n\nNow we can see distributions of Maths scores by class *3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, 3I.*\n\n#### 7.2 Faceting of boxplots\n\nWe can slice the Maths scores in each class by gender for boxplots as shown below.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = CLASS)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER)\n```\n\nAlso we can show the plot in ***vertical*** direction.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = CLASS)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_grid(GENDER~.)\n```\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_grid(GENDER~CLASS)\n```\n\n## 8 Bar charts\n\nNow let us plot bar charts using functions in *ggplot2* package.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"light blue\", colour = \"white\"))\n```\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = fct_infreq(RACE))) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"Race\") +\n  ylab(\"No. of Pupils\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = ..count..),vjust = -1) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,210))\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Hands_on_Ex1.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","editor":"visual","theme":"solar","title":"Hands-on Exercise 1","author":"Fangyuan Zhu","sideNavigator":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
